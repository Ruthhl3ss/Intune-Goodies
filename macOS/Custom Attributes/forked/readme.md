# Custom Attributes for macOS in Intune

This repository contains custom attribute scripts designed for managing macOS devices through **Microsoft Intune**. These scripts help administrators collect additional data about macOS devices, enabling advanced management and monitoring scenarios.

# Note
While most of the scripts are my own, some of them are saved here from other repositories for my own (and perhaps yours) convenience. However, collected scripts will always have the original authors name in the script. Some of the scripts originate from https://github.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/tree/master/macOS . **These (forked) files can be found in the subdirectory "forked"**
