**fetchMicrosoftEdgeVersion.sh**

This script checks for the installed version of Microsoft Edge on macOS and reports the result. It reads the applicationâ€™s version information from its `Info.plist` file.

**Importance**  
Monitoring the installed version of Microsoft Edge helps ensure that the browser is up to date with the latest security patches and features.

**Key Points**  
- Checks the `Info.plist` file for the `CFBundleShortVersionString` attribute.  
- Reports the version number if Microsoft Edge is installed.  
- Reports "Not installed" if Microsoft Edge is not found.
