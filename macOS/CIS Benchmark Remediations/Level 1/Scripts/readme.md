# CIS Benchmark - Custom Implementation

Welcome to the **CIS Benchmark Level 1** repository. This project contains a set of scripts and configuration files designed to align with the **CIS (Center for Internet Security) Level 1 benchmarks**, which provide foundational cybersecurity settings suitable for most organizations. These benchmarks are tailored to help companies start securing their systems and devices effectively.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**Important:** The scripts and configurations in this repository are provided as a starting point. They are not a one-size-fits-all solution and must be evaluated and tested thoroughly before implementation in your environment. Applying these configurations without proper checks could lead to unintended consequences, including system instability or loss of functionality. 

It is your responsibility to:
- Test all scripts and configurations in a non-production environment.
- Validate their impact on your specific infrastructure and requirements.
- Customize them as needed to fit your organization's security policies and operational needs.
- Perhaps most importantly; You should understand what these configurations actually do and what the impact is.
