## CIS Benchmark - Custom Implementation

**macOS - Hardening - Disable "Listen for Siri"**

The "Listen for Siri" feature allows Siri to continuously use the microphone to detect voice commands such as "Hey Siri" or "Siri." 
While useful, this functionality poses risks in organizational environments where sensitive conversations may occur. 
Disabling "Listen for Siri" helps mitigate the potential for unintended data capture or unauthorized recordings.  

**Why Itâ€™s Important**
An always-on microphone increases the likelihood of sensitive information being captured inadvertently during conversations or meetings. This data is processed in the cloud, introducing potential vulnerabilities and risks of data leakage. Previous incidents in similar technologies highlight the importance of limiting this functionality in professional environments.  

By disabling "Listen for Siri," organizations can reduce these risks while still allowing Siri to be used with alternative activation methods, such as a keyboard shortcut.  

## Key Points  
- **Always-On Microphone Disabled**: Prevents continuous listening, reducing the risk of unintentional data capture.  
- **Controlled Activation**: Siri remains available for use through manual activation, such as a keyboard shortcut.  
- **Minimized Data Exposure**: Limits the possibility of sensitive information being processed in external cloud systems.  

## Important Note  
Disabling "Listen for Siri" eliminates hands-free access to Siri. For organizations requiring Siri functionality, alternative activation methods should be implemented. 
Clear communication and user support are necessary to ensure a smooth transition and maintain operational efficiency.
