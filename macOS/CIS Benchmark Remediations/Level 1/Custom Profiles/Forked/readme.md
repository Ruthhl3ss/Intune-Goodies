## CIS Benchmark - Custom Implementation

**Overview**  
The "Improve Assistive Voice Features" setting in macOS shares audio recordings and transcripts of interactions with Vocal Shortcuts and Voice Control to Apple for improvement purposes. 
While this data is anonymized, it may still include personal or sensitive organizational information, making it important to disable this feature unless explicitly approved.

**Why?**
Sharing recordings and transcripts, even anonymously, poses a potential risk of exposing personal or organizational data to a third party. 
Organizations should evaluate the risks of such data sharing and ensure it aligns with their policies before enabling this feature. 
By default, disabling this setting enhances privacy and reduces the risk of unintentional data exposure.  

- **Improves Privacy**: Prevents audio recordings and transcripts from being shared with Apple.  
- **Protects Sensitive Data**: Ensures that potentially personal or organizational information is not forwarded to a third party.  
- **No Impact on Features**: Disabling this setting does not affect the functionality of assistive voice features on macOS.
