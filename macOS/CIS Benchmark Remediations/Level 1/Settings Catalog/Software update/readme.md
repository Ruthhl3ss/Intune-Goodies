**Software Update Settings: Keep macOS Devices Up-to-Date and Secure*



Configuring the Software Update payload ensures that macOS devices stay current with the latest security patches, critical updates, and application improvements. 
By enabling automatic checks and installations, organizations can maintain a secure and consistent environment while restricting end-user modifications to these settings.

**Summary of Settings and Recommended Values:**
- Automatic Check Enabled: True
- Critical Update Install: True
- Automatically Install App Updates: True
- Config Data Install: True
- Automatic Download: True

These settings ensure that macOS devices automatically check for updates, download them as needed, and install critical and app updates without user intervention. 
This approach minimizes vulnerabilities while ensuring devices remain compliant with organizational update policies.
