This configuration profile disables iCloud Drive Document and Desktop Sync

**Note:**

Starting with macOS 10.12, Apple introduced the ability to automatically synchronize the contents of the Desktop and Documents folders with iCloud Drive. 
While this feature offers convenience, it may lead to issues such as insufficient storage capacity, especially given the limited free storage provided by Apple.
Additionally, this synchronization could conflict with enterprise data management policies, as it involves storing files in a third-party public cloud.

To ensure compliance and better control over file storage, this feature should be disabled in enterprise environments. 
Organizations can consider using approved alternatives such as Microsoft OneDrive, which offers enterprise-grade features and integration with data management policies.
