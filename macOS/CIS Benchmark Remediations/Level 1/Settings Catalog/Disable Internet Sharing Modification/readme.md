**Note:**

Internet Sharing allows a Mac to share its internet connection with other devices, effectively functioning as a router. 
While this feature can be useful in certain scenarios, it also increases the system's remote attack surface and may expose the network to unauthorized access.

This minimizes potential risks associated with unapproved devices accessing the system or network.
