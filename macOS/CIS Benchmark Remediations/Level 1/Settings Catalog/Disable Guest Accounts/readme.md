## CIS Benchmark - Custom Implementation

This configuration profile disables the guest account

**Note:**

The guest account in macOS provides access to the system without requiring a username or password. 
While it limits guest users from making system changes or logging in remotely, it still allows temporary access, with all data removed after logout.

Disabling the guest account is recommended to reduce the risk of unauthorized users performing basic reconnaissance or attempting privilege escalation attacks. 
This measure enhances overall system security.
