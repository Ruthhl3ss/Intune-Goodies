**Gatekeeper: Your Mac’s First Line of Defense:**

Gatekeeper is macOS’s built-in security feature that helps protect your system from running untrusted or malicious software. 
It ensures that only apps downloaded from the Mac App Store or identified developers (those who are verified by Apple) can run on your system, reducing the risk of accidentally installing malware.

By requiring apps to be signed and notarized, Gatekeeper acts as a filter, 
blocking potentially harmful applications while still giving you control to allow trusted exceptions when necessary. 
It’s a critical layer of security that works seamlessly in the background, keeping your Mac safe without compromising usability.
