# CIS Level 2 Configuration (Work in Progress)

Welcome to our **CIS Level 2 Configuration** repository! 🎉

## What's Happening Here?
I'm currently building out a comprehensive and secure Level 2 configuration guide based on the [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks). 

This project is still a **work in progress**, so things might look a little incomplete or messy for now. But don't worry, I'm working hard to get everything polished and ready for prime time!

## Why Level 2?
Level 2 configurations are designed for environments where security is critical. Think:

- **Healthcare** 🏥
- **Government** 🏛️
- **Finance** 💰
- ...or anyone who's serious about locking things down 🔒.

## What's Next?
We're adding, tweaking, and testing configurations to make sure they align with best practices and are as user-friendly as possible. Here's what we're focusing on:

- 📚 Clear, detailed documentation
- ✅ Verified compatibility
- 🛠️ Easy-to-follow setup instructions

## How Can You Help?
I'dd love your input! Got ideas, feedback, or spot a potential issue? Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration makes everything better! 🙌

## Stay Tuned
Thanks for stopping by, and I appreciate your patience as I build this out. Keep an eye on this repo. Cool stuff is coming soon! 🚀

Cheers,  
Oktay
