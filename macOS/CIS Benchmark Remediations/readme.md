# CIS Benchmark - Custom Implementation

Welcome to the **CIS Benchmark Level 1** repository. This project contains a set of scripts and configuration files designed to align with the **CIS (Center for Internet Security) Level 1 benchmarks**, which provide foundational cybersecurity settings suitable for most organizations. These benchmarks are tailored to help companies start securing their systems and devices effectively.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**Important:** The scripts and configurations in this repository are provided as a starting point. They are not a one-size-fits-all solution and must be evaluated and tested thoroughly before implementation in your environment. Applying these configurations without proper checks could lead to unintended consequences, including system instability or loss of functionality. 

It is your responsibility to:
- Test all scripts and configurations in a non-production environment.
- Validate their impact on your specific infrastructure and requirements.
- Customize them as needed to fit your organization's security policies and operational needs.
- Perhaps most importantly; You should understand what these configurations actually do and what their impact is.

**By using these scripts, you accept full responsibility for any changes made to your systems.**

**This repository includes custom implementations of these benchmarks, with slight modifications to enhance usability and compatibility across various environments.**
***Implementing the scripts and configuration profiles does not mean you are compliant with the CIS (or any other) benchmark***

## What is CIS Benchmark Level 1?
The CIS Level 1 benchmarks are a set of basic security configurations recommended by the Center for Internet Security. These settings are aimed at improving security without significantly impacting functionality, making them ideal for most organizations as a baseline for security hardening.

## Features
- **Customizable:** Designed to be a starting point; modify as per your organization's needs.
- **Comprehensive:** Covers a broad range of CIS Level 1 recommendations, including system hardening, user account management, logging, and auditing.
- **macOS:** Scripts and configurations are created for macOS and tested on macOS Sequoia 15.2

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the contents of the scripts and configuration files in the `scripts/` and `configs/` directories.
3. Test the scripts in a **non-production environment**.
4. Modify the configurations to suit your specific requirements.
5. Implement the configurations incrementally to reduce the risk of unintended disruptions.
