# Script to add SMB network shares to the Macos Dock

This script will add SMB network shares to the macOS dock. There are two versions in this directory:
- add-smb-shares-2-dock.sh
- minimalistic-version-add-smb-shares-2-dock.sh

You should use the minimalistic version only to test things quick and dirty!

The original script can be found at: https://github.com/microsoft/shell-intune-samples/blob/master/macOS/Config/Dock/addAppstoDock.sh
The original script will also add apps to dock.This script will only add network shares to the dock.
