# macOS Security Baselines

**This repository includes custom implementations of the CIS benchmarks, with slight modifications to enhance usability and compatibility across various environments.**
***Implementing the scripts and configuration profiles does not mean you are compliant with the CIS (or any other) benchmark***

**If you want to audit your security state on macOS devices, have a look at:**

## What is CIS Benchmark Level 2?
Level 2 configurations are designed for environments where security is critical. Think:

- **Healthcare** 🏥
- **Government** 🏛️
- **Finance** 💰
- ...or anyone who's serious about locking things down 🔒.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**Important:** The scripts and configurations in this repository are provided as a starting point. They are not a one-size-fits-all solution and must be evaluated and tested thoroughly before implementation in your environment. Applying these configurations without proper checks could lead to unintended consequences, including system instability or loss of functionality. 

It is your responsibility to:
- Test all scripts and configurations in a non-production environment.
- Validate their impact on your specific infrastructure and requirements.
- Customize them as needed to fit your organization's security policies and operational needs.
- Perhaps most importantly; You should understand what these configurations actually do and what the impact is.

**By using these scripts, you accept full responsibility for any changes made to your systems.**
