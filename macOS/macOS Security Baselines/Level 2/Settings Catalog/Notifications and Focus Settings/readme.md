# CIS Benchmark - macOS Notifications and Focus Configuration

**Key Points**  
- Implements CIS Benchmark Recommendation 2.15.1
- Disables lock screen notifications for key Microsoft applications
- Reduces risk of information leakage
- Supports organizational privacy and security standards

**Configured Applications:**
- Microsoft Outlook

- Microsoft Teams (both versions)

**Notification Settings:**
- Lock Screen Display        > Disabled
