Based on your needs

## Understanding the Table
The table above shows both the CIS (Center for Internet Security) recommended values and our current implementation. Where these values differ, we've made a risk-based decision to either increase security beyond CIS recommendations or to allow specific functionality based on organizational needs. **Review these settings carefully when implementing.**

## Benefits  
- **Enhanced Security**: Limits features that could expose sensitive data or settings.  
- **Improved Privacy**: Reduces data sharing with third parties and between devices.  
- **Organizational Control**: Ensures tighter control over device configuration and usage.  
- **Compliance Alignment**: Supports organizational security policies and compliance efforts.
- **Reduced Data Collection**: Eliminates potential voice data collection by voice assistants.

## ⚠️  IMPACT
Voice assistants like Siri are convenient, but they can be a privacy nightmare. Always listening, always processing—Siri might inadvertently capture sensitive conversations or device interactions.

This configuration takes a no-compromise approach to digital privacy. By completely disabling Siri, you eliminate the potential for unintended data collection and maintain maximum control over your device's capabilities.

⚠️ **Potential Impact:**
- Loss of voice-activated device features
- Manual interaction required for tasks previously handled by Siri
- Enhanced privacy and reduced digital footprint

**Deployment:**
1. Import the JSON configuration to Microsoft Intune
2. Review settings to ensure they meet organizational security standards
3. Assign to appropriate device groups or users

**Note:** This implements CIS Benchmark Level 2 Recommendation 2.5.1 Audit Siri Settings.
