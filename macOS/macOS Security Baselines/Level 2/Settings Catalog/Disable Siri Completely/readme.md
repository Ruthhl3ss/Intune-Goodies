Siri can potentially collect and transmit sensitive user data. Disabling the assistant reduces the risk of unintended information exposure and maintains strict control over device interactions.

**Key Points**  
- Implements CIS Benchmark Level 2 Recommendation 2.5.1
- Comprehensive Siri deactivation across the device
- Prevents potential data collection and transmission
- Supports organizations with stringent privacy requirements

Voice assistants like Siri are convenient, but they can be a privacy nightmare. Always listening, always processingâ€”Siri might inadvertently capture sensitive conversations or device interactions.

This configuration takes a no-compromise approach to digital privacy. By completely disabling Siri, you eliminate the potential for unintended data collection and maintain maximum control over your device's capabilities.

**Configured Settings:**

- Siri Assistant        > Disabled

## Prerequisites
