## Media Sharing Restrictions - Custom Implementation

- CIS Benchmark Level 2: 2.3.3.10 Ensure Media Sharing Is Disabled

This configuration enhances macOS security by **disabling Media Sharing** and **restricting media sharing modifications**. By turning off these features, it reduces potential vulnerabilities that could arise from unauthorized media sharing over the network.

At the same time, it prevents users from re-enabling media sharing, ensuring consistent enforcement of security policies across all devices.

### Why disable media sharing?

Media Sharing can expose sensitive files and data to unauthorized users on the same network. Disabling this feature ensures that devices are not inadvertently sharing media files, reducing the risk of data leaks or breaches.

By also preventing users from modifying these settings, this configuration ensures that the security posture remains intact, aligning with organizational policies.

### Key Config Points

- **Media Sharing Disabled**: Stops devices from sharing media over the network, reducing exposure to potential threats.
- **Media Sharing Modification Restricted**: Ensures users cannot re-enable media sharing, maintaining consistent security enforcement.
- **Enhanced Data Protection**: Minimizes risks associated with unauthorized file sharing and aligns with best security practices.

**Ideal for organizations or users looking to secure their macOS devices from unnecessary network exposure while maintaining strict control over sharing settings.**
