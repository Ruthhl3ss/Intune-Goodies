## CIS Benchmark - Custom Implementation

**macOS - Hardening - Enable Secure Keyboard Entry for Terminal**

This configuration enables **Secure Keyboard Entry** in Terminal, following CIS and NIST recommendations for macOS. 
It prevents other applications or processes from intercepting keystrokes entered into Terminal, reducing the risk of keylogging.  

**Importance**
Secure Keyboard Entry ensures that keystrokes in Terminal are not accessible to unauthorized applications or malicious processes. 
This is particularly important in environments where sensitive data is frequently entered. 

**Key Points** 
- **Prevents Keylogging**: Blocks unauthorized access to keystrokes in Terminal.  
- **Compliance**: Aligns with CIS and NIST security recommendations.  

## Considerations  
Enabling this setting may affect tools or applications that rely on intercepting keyboard input in Terminal.
