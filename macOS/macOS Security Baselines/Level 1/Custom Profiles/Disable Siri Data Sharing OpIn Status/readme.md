## CIS Benchmark - Custom Implementation

**macOS - Hardening - Disable Improve Siri & Dictation**  

**Overview**
The "Improve Siri & Dictation" setting allows Apple to store and review audio from Siri and dictation interactions to improve its services. Disabling this feature prevents audio data from being shared with Apple, ensuring that sensitive or personal information is not forwarded without explicit organizational approval.

**Why Itâ€™s Important**
Sharing audio data with a third party, even for service improvements, introduces potential risks to privacy and security. Organizations should evaluate these risks and ensure compliance with their data sharing policies. Disabling this setting ensures that no audio data is automatically sent to Apple, maintaining user privacy and reducing exposure to external vendors.  

**Key Points**  
- **Enhances Privacy**: Prevents Siri and dictation interactions from being stored or reviewed by Apple.  
- **Protects Sensitive Information**: Reduces the risk of sharing personal or organizational data with external parties.  
- **No Impact on Features**: Siri and dictation functionality remain unaffected when this setting is disabled.
