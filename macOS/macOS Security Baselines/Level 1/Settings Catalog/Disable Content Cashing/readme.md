# CIS Benchmark - Custom Implementation

**Disable Content Caching**

This configuration disables macOS content caching to prevent unauthorized use of the system as a caching server.

**Importance**  
This configuration enhances macOS security and aligns with CIS benchmarks. It helps mitigate potential vulnerabilities by implementing recommended settings.

**Key Points**  
- Implements recommended security settings to reduce risk.  
- Aligns with CIS or other hardening standards for macOS.  
- Supports organizational security policies and compliance efforts.

**Note:**

Content Caching, introduced in macOS High Sierra (10.13), is a feature designed to reduce internet bandwidth usage by caching Apple updates and content locally. 
While it can be valuable in environments with constrained internet bandwidth, its benefits are limited to specific scenarios, such as controlled enterprise networks.

For general use, particularly on mobile devices or untrusted networks, enabling Content Caching may pose security risks and add management complexity. 
Disabling this feature is recommended unless there is a specific operational requirement.

**Note:**
This is a CIS Level 2 recommendation but I included it anyway.
