# Intune-Goodies

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to **Intune-Goodies**. This is a collection of scripts and tools I’ve put together to help make Microsoft Intune management a little easier and more efficient. Over time, I’ve worked on several projects, and this repository is where I share what I’ve learned, especially for macOS.

## 📂 What’s Inside?

- **🔧 Configuration Scripts**  
  These scripts are designed to help automate the setup of devices, making it easier to keep everything consistent and compliant.

- **🎨 Customization Samples**  
  Need to tailor device settings for specific needs? I’ve included examples and templates to help you get started.

## 🍎 macOS Focus

I’ve spent a lot of time working on macOS-specific configuration, and this section reflects that focus:

- **🛡️ CIS Benchmark Configuration Profiles and Scripts**  
  Security is a top priority, and I’ve worked on implementing Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks to help secure macOS devices.

- **⚙️ System Configuration scripts/profiles**  
  Managing system settings can get repetitive, so I’ve included scripts to simplify and automate those tasks.

  - **🏷️ Custom Attributes**  
  If you need more granular control or device-specific configurations, the custom attribute examples here can help you extend Intune's capabilities to monitor your configured items.


## 🚀 How to Use This

1. **🔍 Explore the Repository**  
   Browse through the folders to see what might be helpful for your needs.

2. **📖 Read the Documentation**  
   I’ve added detailed comments and instructions to each script to make them easier to use.

3. **🧪 Test Before Using**  
   It’s always a good idea to test things in a safe environment first to make sure they work as expected.

4. **🤝 Get Involved**  
   If you find something useful or have improvements to share, feel free to contribute! I’m always open to ideas and collaboration.
